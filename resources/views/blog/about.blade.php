            <h4><i>My name is Adityaa Chaubey. I made this blog.
            I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with specialization in Mainframe Technology at University of Petroleum & Engineering Studies, Dehradun. I am fortified with the ability of sound verbal and written communication skills and the ability to work under pressure and I am a quick learner. I have got good programming skills and a grip over languages such as JAVA, C & C++, and C ,HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular JS, Scala and PHP(Laravel). I have sound knowledge of databases i.e., MySQL, MSSQL Server, DB2, Mongodb, postgresql and ORACLE. I can work on Z/OS, Windows and Linux (UBUNTU) Operating Systems. My emphasis is on full stack development, web designing, front end and database handling. I am willing to get good opportunities to work.
